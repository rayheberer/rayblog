# Personal Blog
This repository contains the entirety of my [personal website](http://rayheberer.netlify.com). I have not purchased a domain at this point in time.

## Framework
rayheberer.netlify.com is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a simple yet flexible static website engine.

## Theme
The current theme is a child theme of [Sustain](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-sustain/) by [Nurlan Su](https://github.com/nurlansu). The repository for this theme can be found [here](https://github.com/nurlansu/hugo-sustain).

## Deployment
The site is continuously built and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) in response to any changes pushed to this repository.
