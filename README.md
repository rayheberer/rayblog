# Personal Blog
This repository contains my [personal website](http://rayheberer.ai). I also use it to store miscellaneous data.

## Framework
rayheberer.ai/ is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a simple yet flexible static website engine.

## Theme
The current theme is a child theme of [Hugo Geo](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-geo/) by [Alex Urquhart](https://github.com/alexurquhart). The repository for this theme can be found [here](https://github.com/alexurquhart/hugo-geo).

## Deployment
The site is continuously built and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) in response to any changes pushed to this repository.
