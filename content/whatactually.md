# The "What Actually..." Newsletter

The culture of industry is one which admonishes us not to "reinvent the wheel" at the cost of our understanding and respect for just how hard inventing wheels is.

This newsletter is a way to start conversations with people that feel uncomfortable with the idea of working daily with tools they do not understand. Conversations that start with innocent questions with the form: "What actually is X?"
