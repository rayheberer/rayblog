My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2450020991">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I feel bad giving this book such a low rating. Part of me feels like I came in with the wrong expectations and motivation for reading, and am punishing the authors unfairly for this. In any case, I hope my review does not dissuade people from giving "Fun Retrospectives" a chance, or to use it as a reference.<br /><br />As a front-to-back read, rather than a on-the-shelf reference, the book fares rather poorly. Again, my sympathies to the authors, as an ebook does not lend itself well for a collection like this; a web product like the Wickham family recipes database probably would have been better. However, there were things grammar errors, ugly photos, bad typesetting, and a distracting idea attribution format that really brought the quality of this work down in a distracting way. These may seem like nitpicks, but recently I have been downloading those free ebooks put out by various entities as content marketing, and they have all been better in these regards than "Fun Retrospectives" which I paid for.<br /><br />Caroli has done just fine in collecting interesting retrospective ideas. I just wish a book with such a title would have been more fun to read.
