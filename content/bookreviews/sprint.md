My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2359774553">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Reading this book was simply a positive and valuable experience. At no point did this book impress me in a way that knocked me off my feet, but it also never disappointed me or left me unsatisfied. The concepts introduced by Knapp and his coauthors were helpful and easily applicable to my time in Digital Product School, and helped prepare me for working on a multidisciplinary team. In addition, I gained an understanding of prototyping that played a role in my major hackathon victory alongside two other engineers.<br /><br />Sprint is the sort of book that seems like it would be valuable to revisit, but also exists in a domain where a better, more up-to-date book would exist by the time one found an urge to do so. Nevertheless, even if I do not read it ever again, I have grown from reading it and have tangible results showing that I was at least partly successful in internalizing its message. Everything considered, it is a very worthwhile book to spend even just five days reading.
