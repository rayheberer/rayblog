My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2351557302">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is really an amazing technical resource. Vanderplas manages to keep his content extraordinarily practical and grounded, without being irreverent to the theory like so many lower-quality modern data science texts are. As a contributor to the Python data software libraries such as Scikit-learn, the author is eminently qualified to give a tour of their inner workings. Finally, the book is self-aware of where it lacks depth, and does an excellent job in referring readers to further resources.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2351068166">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Some sections of this were extremely useful. Unfortunately, the examples were rather weak, and felt contrived most of the time. Furthermore, the tonal shifts between professional and conversational did not doing anything for me. Despite these flaws, some of the content is pure gold that I will refer back to again and again, and even looking at the table of contents is great for providing a road-map for personal development as a programmer.
