My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2351068166">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Some sections of this were extremely useful. Unfortunately, the examples were rather weak, and felt contrived most of the time. Furthermore, the tonal shifts between professional and conversational did not doing anything for me. Despite these flaws, some of the content is pure gold that I will refer back to again and again, and even looking at the table of contents is great for providing a road-map for personal development as a programmer.
