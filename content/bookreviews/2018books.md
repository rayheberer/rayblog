My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2493188468">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Perfectly adequate as a study guide. The sections are clear and concise, and are presented in a logical order. It's not a riveting read, and feels very superficial, but for the purposes of preparing for a citizenship knowledge exam, I feel like there isn't a better substitute. This guide gets bonus points from me for having a pleasing colour scheme and well-placed, high-quality photos and imagery.

This had a slow start for me, which led to me putting it aside for many months. However, the last third or so was rather redeeming. Unlike some other books of this sort, Heaven's Devils does not assume the reader is familiar with StarCraft lore, especially because it functions as a sort of a prequel. It was rewarding for me to see the gradual appearance of familiar tech from the games replacing the author-imagined precursors. The slow, ominous reveal of neural resocialization technology had an especially good payoff. Unfortunately, Heaven's Devils ended just as I was really starting to get invested in the characters. In my view the last act had enough tension for at least a few more chapters, and if more of the content had been distributed there, I would have had a much better time reading the book as a whole.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2351557302">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is really an amazing technical resource. Vanderplas manages to keep his content extraordinarily practical and grounded, without being irreverent to the theory like so many lower-quality modern data science texts are. As a contributor to the Python data software libraries such as Scikit-learn, the author is eminently qualified to give a tour of their inner workings. Finally, the book is self-aware of where it lacks depth, and does an excellent job in referring readers to further resources.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2351068166">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Some sections of this were extremely useful. Unfortunately, the examples were rather weak, and felt contrived most of the time. Furthermore, the tonal shifts between professional and conversational did not doing anything for me. Despite these flaws, some of the content is pure gold that I will refer back to again and again, and even looking at the table of contents is great for providing a road-map for personal development as a programmer.
