My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2323490626">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is an inconsistent work whose literary and potential cultural significance exceed its quality. Overall, I enjoyed it, and found it to be often times merely adequate, yet occasionally absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Leaving aside for now the discussion of what this work (book? fanfiction? series?) represents, the slow realization that I found fascinating about HPMOR, once I became immersed in it, was that it is not really focused on the "methods of rationality" themselves, or at least not in the way one would be led to expect by its first few chapters.<br /><br />To me, HPMOR poses many questions, and attacks these questions very thoroughly without fully resolving them. These include, among many others:<br />* What is a hero, and what does it mean to be one?<br />* What is good, and how can one do good?<br />* How does it feel to be rational?<br />* What sort of blind spots might people with knowledge of the methods of rationality have?<br /><br />The six books of HPMOR feature many different "kinds" of intelligent characters, and are an excellent case study in how to write intelligent characters, and how the perceived intellect of a character is related to the intelligence of the author. Lucius and Draco, Harry, Professor Quirrell, Dumbledore, and Hermione all have fascinatingly different methods of thinking - often made transparent for the reader - and they are effective and fail at different points in different ways.<br /><br />At first, the characters did seem a little one-dimensional, as if they were simply mouthpieces through which the author could project different philosophies (this is also one of the flaws of the Matrix Reloaded, if that helps clarify what I mean). However, they grow into their own in a spectacular manner towards the end of the work.<br /><br />I think Yudkowsky writes very well, and I especially appreciate his knack for emphasizing via the Tastefully Capitalized Phrase. I learned a number of new words reading this - certainly more than from most other books I have been reading recently. <br /><br />The term "fanfiction" does not do this work justice. For better or worse, that label carries with it its modern context: nearly unregulated material posted on the internet by just about anyone. To me, HPMOR belongs more to the tradition of authors borrowing characters and settings, such as the Tortoise and Achilles in Hofstadter's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach" rel="nofollow">GEB</a> - although that is not to say I consider it to be anywhere near that level of quality.<br /><br />Brief reviews and ratings of the individual books of HPMOR are as follows...<br /><br />Book 1 - Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres and the Methods of Rationality:<br />Lighthearted, humorous, and often delightful. Reading this is what set up the expectation that HPMOR would be light entertainment with some instructional utility. The ending section of the book, that brings Harry into conflict with Snape, shatters this expectation in a jarring way that broke my suspension of disbelief. 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Book 2 - HPJEV and the Professor's Games:<br />This was the low point of the book for me. Still reeling from the ending of Book 1, I found this book to lack direction and purpose. 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Book 3 - HPJEV and the Shadows of Death:<br />It is here that HPMOR begins to come into its own. The alternate universe comes into focus. For me, this was the point where I began viewing HPMOR as a bona fide work of literature - at least to the same extent the original series is - despite borrowing characters and setting. Book 3 is topped off with a gripping climax which had me completely enthralled. 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Book 4 - Hermione Jean Granger and the Phoenix's Call:<br />This book felt weak, especially after the climax of book 3. Events prior to this felt inconsequential and the experience was quite discontinuous. The quality of writing and well-established, consistent universe work in favor of this book, but don't quite do enough for me. 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Book 5 - HPJEV and the Last Enemy:<br />Suspenseful and thrilling. Deeply emotional. I was swept along by this book, barely noticing when I was already into book 6. 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Book 6 - HPJEV and the Philosopher's Stone:<br />Absolutely spectacular. The payoffs for reading this, after allowing the previous books to build the world and my expectations for it, were enormous. Yudkowsky's humorous genre-awareness really shines. 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />There is so much more that can be said about this series. So much, that I really do mean it when I say that the implications of the work outweigh its actual worth as a piece of literature (which, sadly, does not quite live up to its potential).<br /><br />Averaging my book-wise ratings, I end up with 3.5, which I am inclined to round down to 3. This is in conflict with my current feelings towards HPMOR, since the high-quality ending and promising start are much more salient than the missteps of the middle. I think though, that the Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres in my head is telling me to discount what is salient to me and go with the round-off protocol that I had decided on in advance of rating the books individually.
