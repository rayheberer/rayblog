My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2323495308">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This book managed to surprise me! I'll admit, I was feeling a little skeptical about whether or not I would find Levitt's claims convincing after reading the introduction, and discovering that he self-reports as being "scared of calculus" and values intuition highly. As I began reading, I was prepared to cringe at some improper heuristic being used, or conclusions being teased out of data through the use of "researcher degrees of freedom."<br /><br />If I did cringe at all, it was only once, when in the context of discussing racial bias in online dating, the dataset is first described as being mostly composed of white subjects, and later the statistic that white men who said that race didn't matter send 90 percent of their emails to white women. The point is left on a rhetorical question, asking the reader whether race didn't matter and the subjects of the study just happened to not encounter other profiles, or if the subjects were in fact less open-minded than they claimed. Without explicitly giving the reader the exact proportion of races, that is just inviting base-rate neglect!<br /><br />Aside from that minor point, I found that the two authors were masterful at communicating ideas that ran contrary to conventional wisdom. What especially impressed me was how they managed to do so in a way that I would think would keep the amount of outrage incited to a minimum. Often I would try to imagine myself as someone with strong opinions about some matter, and guess to what extent I would have had knee-jerk negative responses to an assertion in the book, and the answer was something less than it very well could have been, given some of the content. The discussions touching on abortion and gun-control were particularly well-handled.<br /><br />As I began to root for the authors, I also found myself getting scared for them. Too often I know that it is the tendency for scientists to use language that shows they are being cautious; using hedging. For a popular book, I think this would be a weakness, but I also would't want the unfounded statements that characterize a lot of science journalism. Watching Levitt and Dubner toe this line between confident assertions and qualified statements was like watching a tightrope walker going between skyscrapers, and I'm happy to say the authors came out triumphantly on the other side!<br /><br />Perhaps I should have expected as much, once I realized their competence. Levitt clearly has much criticism for conventional experts - of the TV pundit variety, or just those who make a career out of leveraging information asymmetries. To win in a contest against such types and not be categorized with them as simply an opposing expert, the best way would be to take the higher ground, and reason in a way that is transparent and open to fact-checking. While some things are left as magic to non-technical readers (regression analysis in particular), I was more than willing to forgive this by the time I reached the final page.
