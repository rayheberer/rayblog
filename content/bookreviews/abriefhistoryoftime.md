My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2328848996">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The feature of Stephen Hawking's writing that stands out to me the most is its deliberateness. Perhaps for obvious reasons, he seeks to convey most points in the least distance, both in terms of length on a page, and mental gymnastics required. His prose is easy to read, conversational, and inviting.<br /><br />It is somewhat surprising to me that, given Hawking's economy of language and desire not to include equations in the text, "A Brief History of Time" still manages to be almost rigorous in some points. Many equations, such as those for Newtonian gravity, are in fact stated completely in words in a way that does not embellish or diminish them. There can be found many direct mappings from the way Hawking uses words such as "proportional" and "inverse" to the actual equations he is expounding.<br /><br />A strength of this book is that it does not make inferential leaps that are too large at any point. Each idea follows smoothly from the last. However, Hawking does not repeat himself often, and examples are included sparingly - though they are selected tastefully and are of excellent quality. Therefore, this book is perhaps more punishing than others for a reader who may find their attention lapsing only momentarily.<br /><br />I did read this back in 2014, before my first semester at McGill. At that time, I think I must have missed a step or more of reasoning and had my experience of the book diminish towards the end. However, I remember that it gave me a valuable perspective on the milestone accomplishments of physics from the first half of the 20th century and earlier. I find that perspective as valuable today as I did then, and am happy to have it renewed.<br /><br />The latter half of the book is more speculative, and leaves me wanting to research and read about more modern developments to see how the predictions hold up, and what evidence for and against some of Hawking's conjectures has accumulated in the intervening years. Again I find that I appreciated the first half of the book more than the second, but I think there is a way of interacting with the ideas near the end of the book that can allow one to grow, if not in their personal body of knowledge, then in the way they appreciate and respect bold questions.<br /><br />I enjoyed the brief profiles of Einstein, Galileo, and Newton. In my opinion, Hawking puts the spotlight on them as humans, rather than as products of their accomplishments. To me, this is a welcome, often unexplored angle.<br /><br />It is supremely impressive that Stephen Hawking was able to be as prolific as he was. If someone with his condition could leave so many written words behind for posterity - not even mentioning ideas and equations - then there is little excuse for those of us who can speak thousands of words each day! He will be missed, and I look forward to becoming more acquainted with his ideas and legacy.
