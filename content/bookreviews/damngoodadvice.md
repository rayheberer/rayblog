My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2323483638">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This one was a quick read, in term of total time, but I spread it out over many days. In retrospect, this was a good idea when considering Lois as a master of communication. Every piece out of the 120 pieces of advice likely contained a "Big Idea", even if I didn't catch it.<br /><br />My own visceral reaction to this book has come as a surprise. I like it! In general, I feel very positively towards Lois and his book. This is not surprising because I had expectations before reading, but rather because of the nature of the content itself. Lois makes bold, provocative, and sweeping claims. He says things that might not be completely rational, and deals often in absolutes. And yet, I find that I respect him immensely and value all of his perspectives.<br /><br />I like how Lois openly admires his heroes and respects his contemporaries. Unlike in "The Genius Test", I do not feel patronized. One quality in Lois I admire is his way of displaying almost outrageous self-confidence without seeming arrogant.<br /><br />From my point of view, this book's advice is not that damn good for people without talent, however that might be defined. But if it has taught me anything, trying to cover such contingencies as "I am not talented" will not lead to the sort of life and legacy I desire.
