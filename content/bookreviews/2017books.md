I personally found reading this to be a tantalizing experience, one that raised my interest in number theory and encouraged me to find resources to study from. That said, I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone that already has even the smallest idea of something they wish to learn. I was simply fortunate that at the time, I was feeling more curious than I had been in the time preceding my reading, and had a lack of inspiration for how to direct my curiosity. Nevertheless, for its personal contribution to me, I think of this book fondly.

The changes in perspective made this a fun book to read, not just in a recreational manner, but to a small extent as an intellectual activity. Being able to occasionally ask "who is speaking" and having to think back through multiple transitions and narratives shifts provided a sense of pleasure that I did not expect to find in a game-inspired fiction. While the structure of the book made the pacing a little awkward, and had me wondering whether it was worth being emotionally invested in any character at any particular time period in the book, the overall effect was admirable.

I found the story engaging, and especially liked the sense of conspiracy and intrigue that was felt throughout. While it portrayed existing characters well and in a way that allowed them to grow, I felt that the characters introduced were less memorable. There was also, in my opinion, not too much care given to painting a clear visual of novel environments and creatures. However, this partly worked in favor of the book, contributing to its palatable nature and lack of demand for concerted effort of attention on the reader's part. In this sense, it is a fine piece of genre fiction.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2359774553">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Reading this book was simply a positive and valuable experience. At no point did this book impress me in a way that knocked me off my feet, but it also never disappointed me or left me unsatisfied. The concepts introduced by Knapp and his coauthors were helpful and easily applicable to my time in Digital Product School, and helped prepare me for working on a multidisciplinary team. In addition, I gained an understanding of prototyping that played a role in my major hackathon victory alongside two other engineers.<br /><br />Sprint is the sort of book that seems like it would be valuable to revisit, but also exists in a domain where a better, more up-to-date book would exist by the time one found an urge to do so. Nevertheless, even if I do not read it ever again, I have grown from reading it and have tangible results showing that I was at least partly successful in internalizing its message. Everything considered, it is a very worthwhile book to spend even just five days reading.

This was a somewhat useful high-level overview, but to me, the brevity and breadth did not provide enough value that I would recommend this over one or more texts containing more detail. The most useful section for me was that on the bootstrap and bagging.

This text provided me with an extremely solid theoretical and practical foundation in machine learning, and I owe many of my earliest successes in the field to its teachings. I would recommend it to anyone with some math background and a passing interest in the subject. Desiring to program in R is completely optional.

While I found the section on rebasing valuable, I thought most of the sections lacked depth, and did not make up for it by suggesting further resources to gain a deeper understanding. However, the pragmatic approach of the small ebook makes it worthy of future consultation.

What I enjoyed about this was its account of how LinkedIn built its data science team, and some of its philosophies on finding and nurturing talent. Overall, it was a good quick read that was relevant and helpful during the time I was first being introduced to data science as a discipline and career.
