My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2323543494">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Before actually reading this book, I had flipped through some pages while at a bookstore on two or so occasions. This led to me developing the naive expectation that it might be a counterpart to George Lois' "Damn Good Advice." While that book seemed to contain rather poor advice for the "untalented" person, I thought Mark Manson might have good general advice that would be poor for Lois' intended audience.<br /><br />I was wrong. "The Subtle Art..." contains broadly relevant insights, and is more humble and less nihilistic than those out-of-context pages first led me to believe.<br /><br />While part of me objected to the frequent reification of social and psychological constructs - speaking of them as if they were fundamental truths or aspects of physical reality - I came to realize that this was more a feature of the style of the writing, than one of its intended message. I think someone who is willing to resist the urge to be pedantic, as I learned to do, will get more out of this book.<br /><br />The title does not really capture the scope of Manson's theses. This book is just as much about how to give a fuck about what matters, and how to identify what matters in the first place, as it is about how not to give a fuck about those things that don't.<br /><br />I view Mark Manson favorably after reading his work. He does not often argue from authority, and anecdotes are used to motivate concepts, rather than prove them. I would even go so far as to say that the best moments of this book are triumphs of practically applied skepticism and rational thought. That's not to say the entire book is filled with such moments and characterized in this way however.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing that I did not feel especially challenged by this book or its ideas. I think that if one feels defensive, as if they've been called out personally by something written, then they stand to gain something out of it. My lack of such a reaction at best indicates I have already thought about the ideas in "The Subtle Art..." and have less to learn from it, and at worst exposes some massive blind spots and self-delusion.<br /><br />While not groundbreaking, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck" contains respectable arguments, practical distillations of some social science findings, and interesting case studies by the author. I was not particularly impressed by the quality of the writing, but was refreshed by the clarity of thought and surprisingly rational chains of reasoning on display. All in all, a commendable first showing.
