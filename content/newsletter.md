# "The Semi-Periodic Snippet"

As a data scientist, communicable insights often take precedence over clean code. However, technical debt is something very real that builds up over time and can erode the reproducibility and validity of those hard-earned insights.

Here, I share the latest ways I've found to make my analyses more programmatic, using Python or R snippets accompanied by brief explanations. Suggestions and improvements are always welcome. One less copy-paste = one less source of bugs!
