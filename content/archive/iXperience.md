*Devil's Peak.*

As both of my previous posts have mentioned, for the last two months I have been participating in a program called [iXperience](http://ixlink.co/honest-owl). In my opinion, it speaks to the strength of the program that I find it difficult to summarize what exactly it is, but I'll make an attempt anyway. Briefly, iXperience is a summer abroad that offers highly relevant and challenging courses, real work experience, and genuine exposure to a new culture, that seeks to fill in the gaps left by a university education and truly prepare students for the "real" world.

Now, if this were a review of the program, it would be highly positive. As anyone who met me during my time in Cape Town would attest to, I have been extremely successful while here, and so future readers - perhaps students considering iX for themselves - should be advised that like many things, my opinions reflect my personal experience.

However, this isn't a review, in the sense that I'm not going to impose the sort of objective impartiality on myself that I feel is an absolute requirement when writing something of that breed. I do hope that the things I express are relateable and genuine enough that people would still take them into account though when making their own decisions. Rather than a review, today I will be attempting to extract the key ingredients - both in the program and in my own attitude coming into it - that contributed to me having such an empowering and life changing iXperience.


### Learning to Value Others

![](/img/lions-head-friends.jpg)
*Some of the amazing people I've met this summer.*

I had a very bad time in university. So bad, in fact, that I dropped out before finishing my degree. Even before that, I made a last minute decision to transfer from the University of Notre Dame to McGill University after my first year, thinking that a change in surroundings would improve a situation that was mostly a result of personal shortcomings.

While I don't regret leaving - in fact I think I should have done so after my first year instead of transferring - I do believe my biggest mistake was not making an effort to maintain the connections I made each year. In fact, the mistake probably began even earlier, when I didn't bother making these connections deep enough to the point where I could feel comfortable sharing my dissatisfaction with anyone around me.

My poor university experience is tied intimately to a few interrelated personal traits, both positive and negative: I am a very adept learner, capable of teaching myself virtually anything from philosophy to differential equations, at the cost of often being blind to the value of having mentors and peers. Historically, I have put up an invincible front, trying with perhaps shallow success to come across as one of those "smart guys" that excels easily and is "too good" to make an effort, especially in a team setting.

iXperience disrupted this self-destructive attitude in a big way, and also gave me an opportunity to be more honest with those around me, which I am so happy I took.

I was in the [Data Science](http://ixperience.co.za/courses/data-science) course, and from the very first week, it became clear that projects - in particular group projects that demanded collaboration - were going to be the bread and butter of our learning experience. This is almost certainly by design, and is in my opinion a big victory for the program's curriculum structure.

The first week was a big wake up call to me. We were placed into groups of three, and told to make an R package (the result of which is [imgnoise](https://github.com/rayheberer/imgnoise) in my case). Driven by untempered competitiveness, I made decisions without consulting my teammates, and ended up isolating myself on this first project. I can't express how grateful I am to one of my group members for not being afraid to directly tell me "that's not really how group projects work Ray."

This moment forced me to realize that if I was to succeed in the four week course, I would have to come to terms with my deficiencies as a team-player and as a leader. Luckily, and here more credit goes to how iX has built its curriculum and teaching philosophy, I had many opportunities to redeem myself. Every single week following the first one, we had another group project, and I really made an effort to change my attitude from the more self-centered one that resulted in me stealing a learning opportunity away from others.

*A glimpse into the intensely collaborative setting cultivated by iX.*

By the end, I certainly couldn't be said to be a perfect - or even a very good - collaborator, but I don't think I was a bad one either. The very same person who had called me out in the first week joined my team when I pitched the idea to do [exploratory analysis on Spotify data](https://github.com/rayheberer/spotify). It was a redemptive moment. In his review of me, our instructor [Andrew Collier](https://github.com/datawookie) brought attention not only to my technical competence, but to my leadership and mentoring, which I felt was a little generous, but also validating.

My university experience was ultimately a failure because I didn't value people. I arrogantly proclaimed, "I don't need these classes. I can learn all of this on my own." It didn't occur to me that I probably wasn't unique, and that those around me were getting more out of each other, and out of our professors.

I could have learnt all the material in the iXperience Data Science course on my own as well. But I wouldn't have grown as a person, and I would be stuck with the same shortcomings in attitude. I'm still a long way from overcoming them, but having an opportunity to learn to value the insights of my classmates and to look critically at myself as a person, is something I am very grateful for. More so than the specific material taught in class, the highly collaborative environment iXperience cultivated has been absolutely invaluable.


### Finding Role Models

This is very much related to what I've just discussed, but it's also a very important lesson in its own right. Like the above, this particular reason contributing to my successful experience is a combination of iX providing an environment that faciliated a shift in the way I think, and me embracing the change invited by this environment.

In university and the years before, I had a very warped view on admiring and being inspired by others. In my mind, someone had to be absolutely superior to me in nearly every way imaginable before I started treating them as a role model. Likely related to this, was the fact that I was very fragile to criticism, and in fact couldn't stomach it if I felt I was more competent in the domain I was being criticised in than the person doing the criticising. With such a handicapped sense of admiration, I'm pretty sure the only people I looked up to while a university student were those like Richard Feynman or Albert Einstein.

Once again, iXperience disrupted this self-defeating paradigm, and presented an opportunity to mature.

In a sense, the transition was made gentle by the fact that I was first exposed to absolutely amazing people that could probably have won my admiration even when my thoughts were governed by the less mature regime just described. This then had the consequence of nudging me to leave behind such unrealistic standards, see myself in a more humble light, and begin to find things about everyone that were worthy of admiration.

First, let's consider the superstars. At the top of the list there's Andrew. By the second week of class, I already regarded him as an amazing human and scientist, based solely on the clarity of his presentation that revealed his absolute mastery of Data Science. Then I found out that he also had a Ph.D. in physics, and has had a career in physics research and lecturing.

What made an impact on me was that Andrew never introduced himself as, or wanted us to call him "Doctor Collier." Rather, he managed to earn my respect simply by owning the material he taught, and wearing his passion for it on his sleeve. This made me consider that perhaps my attitude towards finding role models had been skewed and naive, and that I needed to change the way I looked at others.

The path towards taking inspiration from others more readily was paved by more amazing people. I won't go into too much depth, but people like Donovan - a highly personable individual who had leveraged these skills to have a very successful career in management consulting - and Aaron - the iXperience CEO who impressed me from the first day by knowing the names of all the students arriving - made it easy for me to transition out of only holding dead theoretical physicists in high regard.

With my eyes starting to open in this way, I quickly found admirable qualities in nearly everyone. From the teaching assistants, who all seemed to be near the beginning of very exciting and rewarding careers of their own, to my peers, who came with a great variety of interests, from a wealth of different fields of study; everyone had many things to offer when I just opened my eyes and looked.

Even outside of the classroom, I found myself admiring the urban rangers, who would lead us on weekend excursions. Hearing their own stories, the things they cared about in the world, and their plans to do good was very inspiring.

It might be the case that everyone in the world has something to offer, but I'm hesitant to get fully behind that point of view, because I think in a way it devalues places that truly have a landscape of excellence. I think iXperience succeeded in bringing together a community of capable and inspirational role models, probably more so than a random collection of people would have been offered. Maybe this is just a sign that I still have more reprogramming of myself to do, but I do think the community here is something special.

So, not only did I learn to value others, but I also learned to respect and receive mentorship from them. Currently, I'm in the [Applied AI](http://ixperience.co.za/courses/applied-ai) course being taught by an industry expert, Raymond Ellis. Unlike with Andrew, the two of us do not have a common background in physics that makes communication inherently easy. If I had come into the course with a more closed mind, I probably would have found it hard to learn from Raymond. Thanks to the transformative experience of my first month, I have found Raymond to be a valuable source of knowledge, even if the two of us tend to say the same things in different ways from time to time.


### Taking Ownership of My Learning

![](/img/iX.jpg)
*Workshop 17, a highly open and innovative environment.*

This point is a little bit of a departure from the previous two, which focused more on my own deficiencies and how being forced to adapt was a good thing. In fact, taking ownership of my learning is something I have always done, and can probably be considered a strength.

University was a poor fit for me not only because of the things I did poorly, but also because it didn't complement and reward the things I do well. I have always been enormously curious, interested in studying things both inside and outside of any course's curriculum, and the university setting was probably not the best environment to support such a mindset (this is why I say above I should have left earlier). The reason for this is largely because the things that guided distribution of effort in university were things like test scores and GPAs, which had little value in their own right while still heavily constraining what it was smart to put time into.

In contrast, iXperience rewarded me at every turn for pushing ahead, doing extra readings, and exploring electives unrelated to the class material. 

In Data Science, Andrew said something along the lines of "there are too many topics to cover any of them in depth, so we will explore as many of them as we can shallowly so you can deepen your strengths on your own" (not an exact quote). He also regularly provided us with resources for us to explore on our own. Books like [The Art of Data Science](https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience) and [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) really helped me acheive both perspective and a deep understanding of what it is Data Scientists did, and some of the tools they employed (in particular machine learning).

In University, if I was excited about a topic being covered in class and began to read ahead, I would be punished the next semester by just being placed into the next class and having to sit through what I had just spent time exploring. In the intensive and ambitious 4-week setting of iXperience courses - which aim to provide instruction equivalent to a semester long course - only good came out of me doing extra readings, staying later to master, say, the principles of functional programming, and taking on ambitious projects that I wouldn't be able to complete within the timeframe of the course.

For instance, the Shiny Web Application I made during my final week in Data Science ([Spotify Top Tracks Features Explorer](https://rayheberer.shinyapps.io/spotify_top_tracks_feature_explorer/)), is still in development even many weeks after the course, and in fact helped me land a paid internship offer.

A big turning point in my learning was during the third week, when we were split into groups and tasked with researching a machine learning model and presenting it to the class in a few days (my group got Support Vector Machines). Instead of jumping into making the presentation, I tried to convince my group to invest time in acheiving a solid understanding ourselves, so that explaining to others would come organically and easily. Many times, I would be asked "so what do you think about this thing about SVMs?" only to have to respond, "I don't know, I'm still learning what machine learning is."

In the end, the fact that I wouldn't be receiving a grade on the presentation allowed me to approach the task with the philosophy that what I ultimately got out of the assignment was the understanding of the topic I walked away with. Ultimately, my group delivered a very strong and coherent presentation, even though we scrambled at the last minute to actually put together our presentation materials.

Having a class structured in such a way that I was encouraged to pursue understanding first was the sort of gratifying experience I was denied in university - one where my curiosity was encouraged. Instead of deadlines being emphasized, the actual product being created became the focus. All of the projects we started in class are now github repositories I still regularly push commits to, and some are on their way to becoming valuable cornerstones in my young portfolio.

But I wasn't only rewarded for digging deeper into the class material. The focus on deliverables and personal understanding over grades was liberating and encouraged me to attend all sorts of electives. iXperience offers many options for exploration on a near-daily basis. From workshops on management consulting and entrepeneurship, to instructional sessions on ballroom dance, Bhangra, and self-defense, to sessions on the Blockchain, there has been so much to feed and encourage my child-like curiosity. And this is not even mentioning the sort of opportunities for cultural growth available just outside in Cape Town.

There was never a moment when I thought, 'I shouldn't try this because I need to finish my assignment.' In this way, ownership of my learning lay not with the institution, but fully in my own hands. And this is a major reason I think iXperience has been nothing short of an amazing time for me.


### Final Thoughts

*Here's to climbing many more peaks together!*

It's hard to judge exactly how big of an impact going to South Africa this summer has and will have on the rest of my life, but by every estimate it is a huge one.

iXperience demanded that I start really trying to change the things about me that have contributed to my past failures in order to succeed, but it also provided an environment that nourished my strengths in a way that university could not.

With the way I've grown these past couple months, I could likely go back and finish my degree very successfully. But with real projects starting to populate my portfolio, job offers already coming in, and a new sense of direction and confidence, I also realize that it's not something I urgently need to do in order to start a great career in the next few years.

One thing I didn't get a chance to talk about so far is the way that iXperience values having a positive impact on its community and giving back to Cape Town at near the same level of importance as giving its students a top-tier education and cultural experience. I think this sort of attitude is something I can learn a lot from, and I hope that the things I do with the powerful things I've learned and tools I've begun to master will keep this perspective of helping others and improving the world in the picture.
