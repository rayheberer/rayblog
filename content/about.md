# About Me

Hello World! My name's Ray.

My interests lie somewhere in the intersection between understanding behavior that I find interesting in humans, such as acting creatively or asking questions, and discovering the methods by which this sort of behavior can be characterized, formalized, and replicated with intentionally designed intelligent agents. My abilities, I hope, are converging towards being distributed such that I am best able to satisfy these interests.

Lately, I've been working as a Data Scientist at a small B2B consultancy called Linnaean. While there, I've developed a keen interest in developing tools that can amplify the productivity and output of both myself and others.

Oh, and I also love music. I used to record a lot of rough demos in high school, check them out below.
