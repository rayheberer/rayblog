# About Me


Hello World!

I always struggle when trying to put what I think of as the essence of my person into words, but if you are to know one thing, it is that I am intensely, naively curious.

My interests lie somewhere in the intersection between understanding behavior that I find interesting in humans, such as acting creatively or asking questions, and discovering the methods by which this sort of behavior can be characterized, formalized, and replicated with intentionally designed intelligent agents. My abilities, I hope, are converging towards being distributed such that I am best able to satisfy these interests.

If I may speak for myself, I ask questions always in the hope of learning that something about the way I posed them reflected a more fundamental lack of understanding, or somehow otherwise slicing through the space of things I don't know that I don't know, leaving me with a greater sense of direction. I hope that I can begin to use my blog in a way that exposes me to the insights and guidance of all those I can learn from - and that includes you!

Oh, and if you were looking for my professional or academic history instead of my personality traits, click on one of those social medial links or check out [my CV](https://rayheberer.github.io/)
